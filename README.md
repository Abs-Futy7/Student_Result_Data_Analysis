# Student Result Analysis

This repository contains a data analysis project focusing on student performance metrics, including Reading Scores, Math Scores, and Writing Scores. The goal is to explore trends, correlations, and insights into the dataset provided.

## Project Structure

The repository includes the following files:

- `Student Result Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the detailed data analysis process and visualizations.
- `student_scores.csv`: The dataset used for the analysis.
- `README.md`: This documentation file.

## Features

- **Data Exploration:** Initial statistics, missing values handling, and visualization.
- **Boxplots:** Comparative distribution of Reading, Math, and Writing scores.
- **Correlations:** Insights into relationships between different score categories.
